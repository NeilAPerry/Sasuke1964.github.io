                    <p class="card-text mb-3">The NetFPGA enables researchers and students to build working prototypes of high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. The NetFPGA has been used in the classroom to teach students how to build Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) switches and Internet Prototcol (IP) routers that use hardware rather than software to forward packets. The NetFPGA hardware can be used by researchers to prototype new types of clean-slate services for next-generation networks. The NetFPGA supports multiple usage models that allow a user to build a hardware-accelerated router with as little or as much customization as they desire.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mb-3">It is well known that routers need buffers, however currently there is little understanding of why they need buffers and how much they need. Buffers that are to small will negatively affect utilization and packet loss. Too large buffers increase cost, heat, power consumption of the router and increase end-to-end latency. Practitioners today typically pick router buffers that are equal to the product of the router’s capacity and the RTT of the average flow thorugh the router. We have developed an analytical model that suggests that router buffers of core routers could be decreased by several orders of magnitude.</p>
